<div style="text-align: justify">
In this project, I am going to perform detailed data preprocessing on the food deliveries raw dataset provided by Doordash, then build classical machine learning models, including Linear Regression, cross-validated LASSO, and Random Forest to predict the food delivery durations using Python.

## Causal Inference and Machine Learning

### Estimate the Effects of Oregon Health Insurance Expansion on Doctor Visits using PDS Lasso and DML
An Causal Inference Project Using Machine Learning Augmented Regression Approach in Python

<div style="text-align: justify">
In this project, I estimate the causal effects of expanding access to Medicaid on the number of doctor visits using the cutting-edge machine learning augmented regression strategy, Post-double Selection Lasso (PDS Lasso) and Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML), in addition to linear regression. As expected, I find the program statistically increases doctor visits later on at 1% level. Different models provide slightly different estimates.

### Unveiling Heterogeneity: Exploring Treatment Effects with Random Causal Forest and EconML Python Libraries
An Causal Inference Project Assessing the Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Random Causal Forest in Python

<div style="text-align: justify">
In this project, to assess the heterogeneity, I build and interpret Random Causal Forest, a popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for Causal Inference, using the EconML Python libraries developed by Microsoft. Specifically, I first predict individual treatment effects based on the model. I then visualize the distribution of effects and assess the importance of various features. Lastly, I explore potential patterns of heterogeneity by analyzing the relationship between the most important features and the estimated treatment effects.
